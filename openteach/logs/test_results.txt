In resting test, I found:
1. There is no big jump of hand tracking from checking the consistency of the delta_T_h.
2. Headset movement will affect the hand pose detection.
3. The robot rotated in a small angle if I nod or see up.
4. The robot won't move if i stay still.

Note: Heahset should try to not move in teleoperation.
